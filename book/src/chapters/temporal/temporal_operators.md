# Temporal Forge

Temporal Forge works by adding additional operators to the language. You can still do everything you could before (with one exception that we'll get to) in Relational Forge, but you get new operators&mdash;new operators like `always` and `eventually`&mdash;that make describing properties and specifying systems easier. Moreover, these operators are standard in industrial model-checking tools.

<!-- ## Temporal Operators: Survey

I wonder if we could add notions of "always" and "eventually" and so on to Forge. That would help us avoid some of the errors that occur when we try to represent lasso traces manually.

~~~admonish note title="CSCI 1710"
Your class exercise today is to try out [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf4nNtzjVhEv3daqZeySbsApoX9L2cwVts23qIzOlX6Ug8nug/viewform?usp=sf_link).  

We're asking whether a _specific trace_ satisfies a constraint that uses the new operators.

Temporal Forge takes away the need for you to explicitly model traces, and gives some convenient syntax for describing what can change over time. But there is something to watch out for: Temporal Forge **forces the engine to only ever find lasso traces**. It's very convenient if that's what you want, but _don't use it if you don't want a lasso trace_!

## Example: Integer Counter

Here's a quick example that motivates how Temporal Forge works, and some pitfalls that can occur when you use it. Suppose that we're modeling a system with a single integer counter:

```forge
#lang forge/temporal

-- enable traces of up to length 10
option max_tracelength 10

one sig Counter {
  -- The value of the "counter" field may vary over time.
  var counter: one Int
}

run {
  -- Temporal-mode formulas are interpreted from an implicit current time. By default, 
  -- we're talking about the start of the trace. So, the counter starts at 0.
  Counter.counter = 0
  -- `always` means "now and at every time in the future". The prime (') operator 
  -- says "value in the next state". So this means that the counter is incremented 
  -- with every transition:
  always Counter.counter' = add[Counter.counter, 1]
} for 3 Int
```

First, notice that we didn't need to define the structure of a trace. We got that for free by using Temporal Forge, which only ever finds traces.

Second, this is _satisfiable_, as we might expect. But what happens if you change the bound on `Int` to `for 4 Int`? 

**Exercise:** Try it. What happens? Why do you think it did happen?

<details>
<summary>Think, then click!</summary>

It's unsatisfiable with the new bound. This is strange: usually when we increase the scope on a `sig`, without using the `exactly` keyword, we only ever make something _satisfiable_ (because we're increasing the possible sizes of instance that Forge checks). 

The problem is that, because **only lasso traces are found**, Forge can only satisfy this model by exploiting integer overflow. At `3 Int`, which supports values between `-4` and `3`, the counter progresses like this: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, (overflow to) `-4`, `-3`, `-2`, `-1`, `0` and so on. We have 10 states to work with, which is enough to wrap around back to `0`. 

In contrast, at `4 Int`, the values range from `-8` to `7`. Overflow will happen as normal, but only when moving from `7` to `-8`. The 10 states we have won't be enough to actually loop back around to `0`&mdash;and there _must_ be a loop somewhere in a lasso trace. So Temporal Forge says that the model is unsatisfiable at trace length 10, `for 4 Int`.

## Converting to Temporal Forge

Let's convert the mutual-exclusion model into Temporal Forge. We'll add the necessary options first:

```alloy
#lang forge/temporal

option max_tracelength 10
```

~~~admonish warning title="Option Names"
Be sure to include the underscore! Misspellings like `maxtracelength` aren't a valid option name.
~~~

Now we'll update the data definitions. Because both the `flags` and `loc` fields change over time, we'll make both of them `var`:

**TODO: double-check; is `World` new? If so, explain.**

```alloy
one sig World {
  var loc: func Thread -> Location,
  var flags: set Thread
```

At any moment in time, every thread is in exactly one location. And, at any moment in time, each thread has either raised or lowered its flag. 

Now for the predicates. In Temporal Forge, we don't have the ability to talk about specific pre- and post-states: the language handles the structure of traces for us. This means we have to change the types of our predicates. For `init`, we have:

```alloy
-- No argument! Temporal mode is implicitly aware of time
pred init {
    all p: Process | World.loc[p] = Uninterested
    no World.flags 
}
```

The loss of a `State` `sig` is perhaps disorienting. How does Forge evaluate `init` without knowing which state we're looking at? **In Temporal Forge, every constraint is evaluated not just in an instance, but in that instance at some _moment in time_**. You don't need to explicitly mention the moment. So the formula `no World.flags` is true exactly when, at the current time, there's no flags raised. Using `init` is like saying "are we in an initial state _right now_?"

Similarly, we'll need to change our transition predicates:

```alloy
-- Only one argument; same reason as above
pred raise[p: Process] {
    // pre.loc[p] = Uninterested
    // post.loc[p] = Waiting
    // post.flags = pre.flags + p
    // all p2: Process - p | post.loc[p2] = pre.loc[p2]

    // GUARD
    World.loc[p] = Uninterested
    // ACTION
    World.loc'[p] = Waiting
    World.flags' = World.flags + p
    all p2: Process - p | World.loc'[p2] = World.loc[p2]
}
```

I've left the old version commented out so you can contrast the two. Again, the predicate is true subject to an implicit moment in time. **The priming (') operator means "this expression in the next state"**; so if `raise` holds at some point in time, it means there is a specific relationship between the current and next moments.

We'll convert the other predicates similarly, and then run the model:

```alloy
run {
    -- start in an initial state
    init
    -- in every state of the lasso, the next state is defined by the transition predicate
    always {some t: Thread | raise[t] or enter[t] or leave[t]}
}
```

This is the general shape of things! There are still some potential problems remaining, but we'll get to them shortly. First, we need to talk about how to view a Temporal Forge instance.

## Running A Temporal Model

When we run, we get something that looks like this:

### New Buttons!

In temporal mode, Sterling has 2 "next" buttons, rather than just one. 
* The "Next Trace" button will hold all non-`var` relations constant, but ask for a new trace that varies the `var` relations. 
* The "Next Config" button forces the non-`var` relations to differ. 
Having different buttons for these two ideas is useful, since otherwise Forge is free to change the value of any relation, even if it's not what you want changed. 

### Trace Minimap

In Temporal Forge, Sterling shows a "mini-map" of the trace in the "Time" tab. You can see the number of states in the trace, as well as where the lasso loops back. 

**It will always be a lasso, because Temporal Forge never finds anything but lassos.**

You can use the navigation arrows, or click on specific states to move the visualization to that state:

Theming works as normal, as do custom visualizers (although read the documentation if you're writing your own visualizer; there are some small changes like using `instances` instead of `instance` to access data).
