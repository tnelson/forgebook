  From figure 2:

Results:

Receiver implementation:
  1. Reply false if term < currentTerm (§5.1)
  2. Reply false if log doesn’t contain an entry at prevLogIndex
     whose term matches prevLogTerm (§5.3)
  3. If an existing entry conflicts with a new one (same index
     but different terms), delete the existing entry and all that
     follow it (§5.3)
  4. Append any new entries not already in the log
  5. If leaderCommit > commitIndex, set commitIndex = min(leaderCommit, index of last new entry)
