# How To Read This Book 

Welcome to Logic for Systems! Here are some quick hints that will help you use this book effectively.

## Navigation
With JavaScript enabled, the table of contents (to the left, by default) will allow you to select a specific section of this book. Likewise, the search bar (enabled via the "Toggle Searchbar" icon) should allow you to search for arbitrary alphanumeric phrases in the full text; unfortunately, non alphanumeric operators are not supported by search at present.

## Callouts 

Callout boxes can give valuable warnings, helpful hints, and other supplemental information. They are color- and symbol-coded depending on the type of information. For example:

~~~admonish tip title="This is a helpful tip."
Make sure to stay hydrated; it will help you learn.
~~~

~~~admonish warning title="This is a warning!"
Look both ways before you cross the street!
~~~

~~~admonish note title="This is a side note."
This book is written using the `mdbook` package. 
~~~

If you see a callout labeled "CSCI 1710", it means that it's specifically for students in Brown University's CSCI 1710 course, Logic for Systems.

## Exercises

Every now and then, you'll find question prompts, followed by a clickable header that looks like this: 

<details>
<summary>Think, then click!</summary>

**SPOILER TEXT**

</details> 

If you click the arrow, it will expand to show hidden text, often revealing an answer or some other piece of information that is meant to be read _after_ you've thought about the question. When you see these exercises, **don't skip past them**, and **don't just read the hidden text**.
