/*
  Model of a ripple-carry adder circuit. Adapted from an Alloy model of the same by 
  Julianne Rudner. Although the carrying can be thought of as temporal, here we model 
  the entire process as one monolithic execution -- i.e., with no propagation delay.

  This is an initial example, which we have not tried to optimize very much.
