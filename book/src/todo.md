# TODOs for Book 

## Critical Path

- integrate validation story (can adapt from slides with Pamela)
- fix up docs, link to constructs as they are introduced
- fill case studies (some just further reading)
    - includes "capstone" distributed-systems example in Forge, Pamela's Chord model as even larger example.
- Motivation: Why model if you have a code verifier? (there's more than code in the world; ease of getting _solutions_ rather than just _executions_)

**Also, the title is way too grandiose.** We aren't actually yet giving much to the "working programmer" who expects code verification, code synthesis, etc. And I'd really like this to be accessible to people outside CS, to be honest.


## Lower-Priority, Higher-Cost 

- syntax highlighting for Forge in code blocks
- Easy way to link to docs from keywords. Scribble made this easy. Here, do I need to always add a full markdown link for every instance of a keyword?
- Forge playground: runnable models
