# TODOs for Book 

## Critical Path

- integrate validation story (can adapt from slides with Pamela)
- clean up docs, link to constructs as they are introduced (how to do this smoothly in mdbook?); make sure search is functional for docs location
- fill case studies (some are just further reading)
    - includes "capstone" distributed-systems example in Forge, Pamela's Chord model as even larger example.
    - includes ABAC
- Motivation: Why model if you have a code verifier? (there's more than code in the world; ease of getting _solutions_ rather than just _executions_)
- "could add":
  - traffic light example
  - Q&A, especially about composition of models (Dijkstra, Prim)
  - memory management is a homework, so didn't add it


## Lower-Priority, Higher-Cost 

- syntax highlighting for Forge in code blocks
- Easy way to link to docs from keywords. Scribble made this easy. Here, do I need to always add a full markdown link for every instance of a keyword?
- Forge playground: runnable models
